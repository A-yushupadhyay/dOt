{"user_id": "test_user", "input": "fever", "output": "fever blister\n\nMedically known as Herpetic Labialis, it does not, as the name \u201cfever\u201d blister might imply, always occur with a fever. Fever blisters appear on the lips as a series of small, fluid-filled, sometimes painful, fluid-filled or red bumps.\n\nThey can occasionally appear anywhere on the body, but in more than 90% of cases they occur on the lips. Sometimes referred to as cold sores, they are caused by the herpes simplex virus, which is highly contagious during an outbreak. Although transmitted most often by kissing or oral sex, the virus is contagious even before an outbreak and even after healing, so the chance of transmitting the virus is higher than the incidence of outbreaks. The virus lies dormant within the body and can cause recurrent outbreaks.\n\nPrevention methods include the use of a condom during sexual activity and avoiding lip contact with those already afflicted, in addition to washing hands often and keeping fingernails short to reduce the chances of accidental contact. If exposed to the virus or experiencing initial symptoms such as tingling or itching, a topical emollient such as Vaseline can offer temporary relief, but a doctor should still be contacted. Over-the-counter creams and prescription medications are available for symptom relief for those experiencing frequent or long-lasting outbreaks.\n\nNOTE: This official version of this entry was revised December 17, 2014, using text supplied by the American Medical Association, Copyright 2014.
